The various roles which a woman plays through their lifespan and the societal pressures and expectations which come along with it play a huge role in the increased occurrence of mental health related conditions in women. The expectation to juggle multiple roles including that of a caregiver, employee and homemaker, while also maintaining a certain appearance or personality is an important contributor and the constant feeling of falling short of them can further add to the cause.",
